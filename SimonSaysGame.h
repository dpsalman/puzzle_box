/*
 * This sketch is a simple version of the famous Simon Says game. You can use it and improved it adding
 * levels and everything you want to increase the diffuculty! There are n buttons connected to any 
 * sequentual digital pinouts. The buttons from A0 to A3 are used to insert the right sequence.
 *
 * When a wrong sequence is inserted all the leds will blink for three time very fast otherwhise the
 * inserted sequence is correct.

Hardware needed:

5x pushbuttons
1x Blue led
1x Yellow led
1x Red led
1x Green Led
4x 1k resistors
4x 10k resisors
10x jumpers
